# Helm
Helm is an open-source graduated CNCF project originally created by DeisLabs as a third-party utility, now known as the package manager for Kubernetes, focused on automating the Kubernetes applications lifecycle in a simple and consistent way.

The objective of Helm as package manager is to make an easy and automated management (install, update, or uninstall) of packages for Kubernetes applications, and deploy them with just a few commands.

## Why use Helm?
Deploying your applications manually seems complex without using Helm. You will have to define every single YAML configuration, from configuring your workloads to how (and what) you want them to be deployed. And itâ€™s not only that. After defining and debugging the YAML, think about what will happen after updating the application? You will have to manually remove all created resources and re-deploy them for the new version, which can be slightly mitigated if you create additional files for automation, but that costs additional effort.

Helm is the simplification of this. With Helm, you can simply download your preferred Helm chart, deploy it in the cluster, and update or delete it with low effort. Helm means several benefits for your application:

  1. Offers Helm charts and repositories where you get everything necessary for deployment and its configurations.
  2. Official Helm charts are up to date and maintained with new releases.
  3. Allows you to jump between your preferred versions of the Helm chart.
  4. Everything with just a single CLI command.

Helm charts are structured like this:
```
    mychart/
      Chart.yaml
      values.yaml
      charts/
      templates/
      ...
```
  The templates/ directory is for template files. When Helm evaluates a chart, it will send all of the files in the templates/ directory through the template rendering engine. 
  It then collects the results of those templates and sends them on to Kubernetes.
  
  The values.yaml file is also important to templates. This file contains the default values for a chart. These values may be overridden by users during helm install or helm 
  upgrade.
  
  The Chart.yaml file contains a description of the chart. You can access it from within a template.
  
  The charts/ directory may contain other charts (which we call subcharts). Later in this guide we will see how those work when it comes to template rendering.

## Helm installation on Ubuntu

```bash
curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg] https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
```
